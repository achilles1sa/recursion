I draw a circle and then draw other four circles around it. I continue the
process in an anti-clockwise manner. I also draw the circles in different colors.

 1. public static void main(String[] args)
 2. private static void circle
 3. private static void matrix

 ******************************************************************************/

    [ ] call one or more Transform2D method

    [X] use different parameters than our examples: f(n, x, y, size)

    [X] use different StdDraw methods than in examples (e.g.,
        ellipses, arcs, text)

    [ ] number of recursive calls not constant per level (e.g.,
        conditional recursion)

    [ ] mutually recursive methods

    [ ] multiple recursive methods

    [ ] doesn't always recur from level n to level n-1

    [ ] draw between recursive calls, not just before/after all
        recursive calls

    [ ] use recursive level for secondary purpose (e.g., level
        dictates color)


/******************************************************************************

    [ ] I do *NOT* want my art to be shared with the class.

Yes or no?
No
